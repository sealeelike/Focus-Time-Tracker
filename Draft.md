It is now reading week for the final exam. I have many stuff to review.
While sitting in the library, I sometimes suddenly find myself spacing out.
I am thinking about making a monitor that stands by all the day (just like I sitting here all the day) and monitors the user.

It consist of two component, a camera (It might include multiple functions, such as eye tracking) and a movement analysis model.
At the end of the day, the user can view an overview of their focus data over a period of time. The user's different states are determined through model analysis.
The camera can be easily fixed on one's desk or laptop. 
For basic analysis that doesn't require any special camera features, it might be possible to run it directly on a laptop. So a simplified version that only use a laptop camera will be considered too.

But I also hope this app will only be used by users who voluntarily choose to monitor themselves, rather than company managers enslaving the company's employees.
There must be a mechanism that allows those being monitored to easily disguise their behavior or stop the recording. For example, when the boss leaves, employees can increase their concentration time by 10 minutes by shaking their heads three times in a row.
This mechanism should be undetectable within my application.
